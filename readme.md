armBAND

A project for DorkbotPDX May 2015 OpenLab:  http://dorkbotpdx.org/openlab_05_2015

I'm hoping to get two or three people to build things that react to this Myo Armband I got.  In order to make that happen, I've built a server that spits out the muscle data (EMG) from the armband.  The data is sent via OSC (direct or broadcast udp) and is published via WebSockets.

I've written two example apps that react to the data streams to give people a starting point.

This is rough currently, I hope to smooth it out soon!
